Being in IT for over a decade, and in recent years a Systems Administrator, there is a critical and fundamental need to ensure the data of my organization is safe from external (and internal) unauthorized access. Being able to detect threats and intrusions is the reason I’ve decided to prioritize my personal development in the area of InfoSec. 

Why InfoSec? 

Because I can’t afford to be ignorant when it comes to security - nobody can. Being vulnerable and helpless when your data has been compromised and you don’t know what to do besides change your password isn't enough. I want to know the origin and method of the attack and what information was collected. I want to be ahead of it and not a victim.  Additionally, I’d also like to have some fun…

These are a few things I’d like to accomplish in the next 12 months:

  - Bypass GPP (Group Policy Preferences) by elevating privilege to local administrator as an end user.

  - Use my iPhone’s NFC reader for more than Apple Pay - I want to use it as my badge to unlock my door at work on days I forget my badge. 

  - Build a LAMP web server with WordPress using a Raspberry Pi . Bonus points: Include an AI chatbot.
